# Motivation

This library is intended to become a robust foundation for animation in Ember.
A future version of liquid-fire will be implemented on top of this.

# Installation

```sh
ember install ember-animated
```

This repo is tested against Ember versions going back as far as 1.13.
For Ember versions older than 2.3, you will also need to install the following addons:

- `ember-hash-helper-polyfill`
- `ember-getowner-polyfill` _(1.1.0+)_
- `ember-assign-polyfill`
